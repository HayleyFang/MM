\usage{
estpars(data, xreg = "cumcases", IP = 2, seasonality = "standard",
  regtype = "gaussian", sigmamax = 3, family = "gaussian",
  userYhat = numeric(), alpha = NULL, sbar = NULL, printon = F)
}
\arguments{
\item{data,}{the data frame containing cases and interpolated births and populations.}

\item{xreg,}{the x-axis for the regression. Options are 'cumcases' and 'cumbirths'. Defaults to 'cumcases'.}

\item{IP,}{the infectious period in weeks. Defaults to 2 weeks.}

\item{seasonality,}{the type of contact to use. Options are standard for 52/IP point contact or schoolterm for just a two point on off contact. Defaults to standard.}

\item{regtype,}{the type of regression used in susceptible reconstruction.
Options are 'gaussian', 'lm' (linear model), 'spline' (smooth.spline with 2.5 degrees freedom),
'lowess' (with f = 2/3, iter = 1), 'loess' (degree 1), and 'user' which is just a user inputed vector.
Defaults to 'gaussian' and if that fails then defaults to loess.}

\item{sigmamax,}{the inverse kernal width for the gaussian regression. Default is 3.
Smaller, stochastic outbreaks tend to need a lower sigma.}

\item{family,}{the family in the GLM regression, options are poisson and gaussian both with
log link. Default is Poisson.}

\item{userYhat,}{the inputed regression vector if regtype='user'. Defaults to NULL.}

\item{alpha,}{the mixing parameter. Defaults to NULL, i.e. the function estimates alpha.}

\item{sbar,}{the mean number of susceptibles. Defaults to NULL, i.e. the function estimates sbar.}

\item{printon,}{whether to show diagnostic prints or not, defaults to FALSE.}

\item{fit,}{the fitting method used. Options are 'glm' or 'bayesglm' which is a cheap adaptation
to include some bayesian approaches. For 'bayesglm' we use a gaussian prior with mean 1e-4.}
}
\description{
This function computes the set up to run the TSIR model, i.e. reconstructes susecptibles and
estimates beta and alpha.
